# Lists

So far in *Setanta* we've only been using text and numbers in our programs. These have allowed us to do some powerful stuff, but they are also very limiting.

What if we want to deal with more than one piece of text, or more than one number. That's where **lists** come in. Lists, unsurprisingly, allow us to store values in a list.

## How to make a list

Lists are created with square brackets (`[, ]`) around the outside and commas (`,`) to separate the elements of the list, for example: `[100, 200, 300]`{.setanta} is a list with 3 elements. 100 is the first element, 200 is the second, and 300 is the last element. `[]` is an empty list.

Try adding a fourth element to the list `[1, 2, 3]`{.setanta} here:

{{{
scr√≠obh([1, 2, 3])
}}}
