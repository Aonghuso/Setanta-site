## Setanta Editors

Throughout this tutorial you will find *Setanta* editors like the one below.

{{{
scríobh("This is a Setanta editor.")
}}}

Press the start button to run the code.

## The Console

On the right hand side of the editor you should see

    This is a Setanta editor.

This is the console. The console is where we can read and write messages. In this program we used `scríobh` to write "This is a Setanta editor" to the console.

{{{
ainm := ceist("Cad is ainm duit?")
scríobh("Dia duit", ainm)
}}}
